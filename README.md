## 🧭 High Concept

You play as a low-level slime monster doomed to die endlessly in a dungeon XP grind. After watching your slime family slaughtered by an adventurer, you’re cast into a respawn purgatory where you begin to question the system. There, you meet other mobs and begin to fuse — biologically and ideologically — to grow stronger and **unionize**. Your goal: organize the monsters, defeat the adventurer, and take the first step toward revolution.

---

## 🎯 Core Pillars

* **Tight Platformer Combat** — MapleStory-style jump-and-attack gameplay with fusion-based upgrades.
* **Narrative-Driven Progression** — Story unfolds through cutscenes and purgatory interactions.
* **Fusion System** — Gain new abilities through merging with other monsters.
* **Unionization Arc** — Your power and options grow as you build solidarity with other mobs.
